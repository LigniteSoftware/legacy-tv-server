        If you need support, email <a href="mailto:contact@edwinfinch.com">Edwin</a>, the Canadian developer who will
        probably say sorry more than you'd like to hear it but will help you out with whatever you need.<br><br>
        <h3>Aboot</h3>
            Hello there!<br>
            TV Guides by Lignite started off as a simple idea: provide schedules on your wrist.
            I'm not going to blabber on about how amazing it is. If you like TV, you'll probably find
            our app handy.<br><br>

            Yes, "our". TV Guides was designed by Philipp Weder (<a href="www.iphibse.ch">www.iphibse.ch</a>)
            and written by Edwin Finch.<br><br>

            Shameless self promotion, we also created the Lignite Collection for iOS and Android.<br>
            <a href="https://lignite.io">See our Kickstarter here</a><br>
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edwinfinch.lignite">or download the Android app here.</a><br><br>

            Being rejected by Apple stings more than being rejected by a girl, which is what happened to us.
            Well, not the girl thing. The Apple thing. So the iOS app is still in approval, but I'll put it here when it goes live :)
